  * From The Gaia Benchmark Stars Library pipeline

Co-added solar spectrum observed with NARVAL and radial velocity shifted taking HARPS solar observation as a reference. Telluric lines have been removed, so it is suitable for cross correlation.

Synthetic spectra generated by SPECTRUM using MARCS.GES model, VALD linelist
and solar parameters (teff 5777.0, logg 4.44, feh 0.00, vmic 1.07 and vmac 4.19)
R ~ 300,000


- Synth.Tellurics.350_1100nm.txt.gz:
  * From The Gaia Benchmark Stars Library pipeline

Synthetic telluric spectra from 'http://www.pole-ether.fr/tapas/'. This version was resampled
(0.001 instead of 0.0001) to reduce space.
